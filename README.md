# Using the Code Attachments

These code attachments serve two main purposes:
You can compare your code to mine to find + fix errors in your code
You can run my code to see what we build / how it should behave
Running my Code
If you want to run my attached code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Run ```npm install``` in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This
will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise (it's not in the attachment
because that would bloat the ZIP file)
2. Run ```npm run serve``` to bring up the development server, view the app at `localhost:8080`
(or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
